[Tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) is 4D object which is not possible in our 3D space.

## about

This project is created to show basic knowledge about *2D and 3D animation* in *matplotlib library* and to show its application in *maths/science*.

Hear, in *for_fun_only folder(Directory)* some crazy thing is available you can also execute that using bellow [Execution process](#Execution-Process).

## Basic introduction

If there is *nD object* in *nD space* then it can be projected in *n-1D* or we can say that we can get its shadow in *n-1D*.

EX. We can get A *projection(shadow)* of *cube(3D)* on *paper(2D plane)*.

So, here the projection of *cube(3D object)* in *2D plane* and projection of *tesseract(4D object)* in *3D space*.

To take shadow of points or shape two important process:
  - Rotation
  - Projection
  
This simulation shows that by changing the *speed* and *angle* of Rotation how projection changes.

## Requirements to Execute code
- Python v3.7
- Matplotlib library
- Numpy library

## Requirements to Understand code
- Python v3.7
- Matplotlib library
- Numpy library
- Text Editor(PyCharm if possible)
- Knowledge about [Tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract)
- Knowledge about [operation on matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)#Basic_operations)
- Knowledge about [rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) and [projection matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_matrix)

## Execution Process
- If possible use *PyCharm* but terminal(console) also works
- Install required libraries
  - *pip install matplotlib*(matplotlib library)
  - *pip install numpy*(numpy library)
- Put all .py files in a folder(Directory)
- Execute any file [cube_projection_in_2D.py](cube_projection_in_2D.py) or [Tesseract_projection_in_3d.py](Tesseract_projection_in_3d.py).
- Change variable to see different simmulations.

## Suggestion
First try to understand [cube_projection_in_2D.py](cube_projection_in_2D.py) then go for [Tesseract_projection_in_3d.py](Tesseract_projection_in_3d.py).
