[Tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) is 4D object which is not possible in our 3D space.

### about

This project is created to show basic knowledge about 2D and 3D animation in matplotlib library and to show its application in maths/science.

Hear, in for_fun_only folder(Directory) some crazy thing is available you can also execute that using bellow Execution process.

### Basic introduction

If there is nD object in nD space then it can be projected in n-1D or we can say that we can get its shadow in n-1D.

EX. We can get A projection(shadow) of cube(3D) on paper(2D plane).

So, here the projection of cube(3D object) in 2D plane and projection of tesseract(4D object) in 3D space.

To take shadow of points or shape two important process:
  - Rotation
  - Projection
  
This simulation shows that by changing the speed and angle of Rotation how projection changes.
